# TASTE.md — the shipped taste profile

**Status: EXAMPLE PROFILE — not confirmed by any user.** Per SKILL.md Step 0, onboarding MUST run until a `Confirmed-by: <name> (<date>)` line replaces this status line — even for this profile's original author.

> A sourcing skill is only as good as its taste. This file is the curation layer [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) loads before sourcing anything: which kinds of b-roll to reach for, how fast to cut, and which sources are trusted. It ships with **my** taste (Louise's — I make fast-cut tech/marketing video) so the skill makes good calls out of the box. Fork it and make it yours — see [Make it yours](#make-it-yours) at the bottom.

## Where this taste comes from

Two signals, in order of strength:

1. **Revealed taste** — extracted from my actual published videos, not from what I *say* I like. Method: scene-cut detection on the final cut (`ffmpeg select='gt(scene,0.3)'` → frame montage → catalog every cutaway by type, count the cuts). What you ship beats what you follow.
2. **Curated sources** — my YouTube subscriptions, auto-imported then pruned to the b-roll-worthy ~10%, tagged by topic so a tech video never gets scoped to my surf vlogs.

## The fingerprint (revealed from real videos)

**B-roll types I actually use, in rough order of frequency:**

1. **Screenshots / receipts** — tweets, social posts, forum threads, documents, search results. Heavy. → the **Receipts** route.
2. **Text / title cards** — dark navy (or bold color) background, short punchy text. The motion-graphic look. → pairs with **Concept**.
3. **Full-frame cutaways, green-screen composited** — b-roll fills the frame, often with the speaker keyed in.
4. **Memes / face reactions** — occasional, anchored on a punchline. → the **Meme** library loop.
5. **Products** — clean full-frame product shots. → **Entity/Product**.
6. **Historical / vintage imagery** — sepia portraits, archival moments. → **Entity/Historical**.

**Pacing (measured across two published videos — a 69s fast-cut explainer with 33 shots, and a 123s storytelling video with 54 shots):** **~26–28 cuts/min**, **median shot ~1.6–1.9s**. Sub-second insert bursts are a signature move — e.g. four receipt screenshots fired in 1.2 seconds (a "receipt montage"). The longest holds (6–14s) go to the one explainer beat per video. So: cut roughly every 2 seconds; b-roll coverage ranges **~20% (talky explainer) → ~50% (dense storytelling)**.

**Compositing:** talking head on green-screen / bold colored backgrounds, alternating fast with full-bleed cutaways.

**Notably ABSENT — and this is the load-bearing insight:** random "creator clip from a channel I follow" b-roll. I do not pull vibe clips off other YouTubers. The taste-risky **Cultural** route is almost never needed; real b-roll here is Receipts + Entity + Memes + on-brand text cards — mostly the OBJECTIVE routes, where there's a checkably *correct* clip. **That's why an agent can source for me at all: my taste rarely asks it to guess.** When you fork this profile, check your own published videos for the same property before letting the agent near vibe-based sourcing.

## Trusted sources (YouTube, tagged by topic)

Searches stay INSIDE this list (plus any source the script itself references). Topic tags scope each video: a `tech` video only searches `tech`-tagged sources.

### Tech / AI
- @anthropic-ai [tech] — Anthropic official — AUTHORITATIVE for "how AI/LLMs work" credibility flex (interpretability, "Tracing the thoughts of an LLM")

- @3blue1brown [tech] — best "how LLMs work" visual explainers
- WIRED [tech] — explainers, "X explained in N levels", product breakdowns
- Silicon Mania [tech] — tech/startup commentary
- KRAZAM [tech, comedy] — tech satire skits — GREAT meme/reaction b-roll for tech beats
- Mark Rober [tech] — engineering spectacle, gadget moments
- Hannah Fry [tech] — math/AI/data explainers, credibility flex

## Guardrails

- **Audio: ALWAYS SILENT** — I talk over all b-roll. Every sourced clip gets its audio stripped (`ffmpeg -an`). Never hand back a clip with sound. (This is my answer to onboarding question 1 in SKILL.md; yours may differ.)
- **Stills motion: subtle sub-pixel zoom-in by default** — ~1.5%/sec, centered, rendered sub-pixel (PIL float-box Lanczos). ffmpeg `zoompan`/crop-pans stay banned at any speed (integer-stepped = shaky); no pans, nothing faster than ~2%/sec.
- **Scoping: no random videos** — searches stay inside the trusted list + script-referenced sources; for "how X works", go to the authoritative source (AI → Anthropic/OpenAI/3Blue1Brown). Open YouTube search only as a flagged last resort.
- **On-brand:** tech-literate, a bit irreverent — I market a screen recorder ([Tella](https://tella.tv)), so Loom-bashing is welcome.
- **Off-limits:** _(fill in yours — e.g. nothing political? clip length cap? minimum resolution?)_

## Defaults

- **Default video topic:** tech
- **Default output format (sourcing only):** silent · 9:16 1080×1920 · ~3s · anchored after the punchline

## Template sections (fill in as they come up)

- **Accounts I quote (X / LinkedIn):** the people whose takes/moments you reference — add them as the agent asks.
- **Reference bank (movies / shows / comedians / running jokes):** specific bits you reach for.
- **Recurring targets:** the meme/clip you keep wanting.

## Make it yours

This profile is the template — the structure transfers even if my channels don't. Three steps:

1. **Import-then-prune, not a blank interview.** Pull your YouTube subscriptions with no API key by reading your logged-in browser cookies:
   ```bash
   yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome --flat-playlist \
     --print "%(uploader)s ||| %(channel_url)s" \
     "https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels"
   ```
   Then have the agent categorize them with you and prune hard — of my ~280 subscriptions, only ~25 were b-roll-worthy. Bench the rest with a topic tag (`lifestyle`, dormant) instead of deleting; you'll want them the day you make a video on that topic.

2. **Reveal your fingerprint from your own published videos** (strongest signal — do this if you've shipped anything): scene-cut detect your best video, montage the frames, catalog every cutaway by type, count cuts/min. Replace my fingerprint section with what you actually use.

3. **Answer the guardrails** — audio, stills motion, off-limits, on-brand voice — and set your default topic.

No published videos yet? Seed taste from **exemplars** instead: give the agent 3–5 b-roll moments you loved in other people's videos and let it extract the pattern.
